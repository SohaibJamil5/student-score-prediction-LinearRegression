# 🎓 Student Score Prediction (Internship Project)

This project is part of my AI/ML internship.  
It builds a machine learning model to predict a student’s final exam score based on multiple academic and lifestyle factors.

## 📁 Dataset Features

- `Study_Hours_per_Week`
- `Attendance_Rate`
- `Past_Exam_Scores`
- `Gender`
- `Parental_Education_Level`
- `Internet_Access_at_Home`
- `Extracurricular_Activities`
- `Final_Exam_Score` *(target variable)*

---

## 🔧 Tools Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (Linear Regression)
- Google Colab (Development Environment)

---

## 📊 Results

- **R² Score:** ~55%
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 2.4
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 8.9

🔍 The relatively low R² score highlights the importance of better data quality and feature engineering in real-world ML tasks.
